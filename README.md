# Code Quiz

## A quick game to test your JavaScript fundamentals!

### Guide:

To start the quiz, simply click on the purple "Start Quiz" button displayed in the center of the screen. Once it is clicked, the countdown timer will begin counting down from 50 seconds, which can be found in the top right corner of the screen. There are five questions to answer, and the score for the user is the remaining time left in the countdown. If you answer a question incorrectly, the countdown timer will lose ten seconds. If you answer too many questions incorrectly or the timer runs out at zero seconds, your score will be zero. Once you complete the quiz, you will be sent to a submit score screen where you can type in your initials to keep a record of your scores in local storage. After submitting your initials in score, you will be sent to the highscores page, where you will see all the scores that have been stored in your local storage. To reset this score, simply click the "Clear Highscores' button to clear your local storage and remove the scores from the page. You can also access the high scores screen before taking the quiz by clicking the high scores link in the top left hand corner of the start screen.
